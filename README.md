# About

This is a repository with a few data visualisations that are part of the
[projects](https://www.danielcapistrano.com/#projects) that I participated in.

You can use the code inside the `index.qmd` file to reproduce any of the plots. 

Feel free to use, copy, modify, or distribute the code.
